title: Gradient Trader -  A CryptoCurrency Trader Powered By Deep Q-Learning
---

Welcome to Gradient Trader - a cryptocurrency trading platform using deep learning. We are four UC Berkeley students completing our Masters of Information and Data Science. Some of us come from a finance background, others with expertise in deep learning / reinforcement learning, and some are just interested in the cryptocurrency market. With that, we’d like to present our work to you and hope you’ll share with others that may find this blog of interest!

The popularity of cryptocurrencies has grown tremendously over the years. While it remains a  highly speculative market, its mention in mainstream media, the growth of hedge funds focused solely on cryptocurrencies, and the backing of such currencies by established investors has given rise to a greater number of investors. 

Created in the year 2000, Bitcoin was introduced as the first cryptocurrency. Since 2011, the price of bitcoin has increased by 1,100,000%, recently reaching a cost of $11,000 per coin!
