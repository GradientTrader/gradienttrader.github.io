### More Information

Thank you for checking out our work at Gradient Trader. We are a group of four who recently completed our Masters of Information and Data Science from UC Berkeley. Some of us come from a finance background, others with expertise in deep learning / reinforcement learning, and some got their first exposure to the cryptocurrency market with this project. We'd love to hear your feedback and questions on the project so feel free to ping us at the email(s) below, thank you!
